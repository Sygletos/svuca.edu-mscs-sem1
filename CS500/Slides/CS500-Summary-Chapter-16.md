## Distributed System Structures
### Distributed System:
__Definition:__ Collection of Processors that do not share memory or a clock, communicating through networks.  

* **Processors**: varies in size, functions; including all types of computers.
* **Site**: location of a computer system.
* **Host**: specific system at a site (e.g., server, client)

Four **reasons** for Distributed Systems: **resource sharing**, **computation speedup**, **reliability**, and **communication**.

### Network-Based Operating Systems
There are 2 types of network based OSs.

#### Network Operating Systems
User must know the techniques, or which resources to query, where to obtain the resources, i.e. command sets before hand. **Example**: *Remote logging* (telnet, ssh), *Remote desktop* (RDP), *Data Transfer* (s/FTP, SCP)  



#### Distributed Operating Systems
User does not need to have special knowledge about remote system, just **access them as local resources**, all *data migration*, *computation migration* and *process migration* is taken care by the distributed OS. 


Two techniques to move processes in network: by OS (transparent to users), or by users' specific inputs.  

Characteristics of Client / Server Computing: ely on user-friendly app, share services on server side, common DB server, high priority on network management and secury. 

#### Client / Server Computing
> Key feature is allocation of tasks between Client & Server.

> * Client / Server must share same protocol, support same app.
> * Easy to use GUI
> * Possible to have different OSes

1. **Client/Server Classes**

    There are 4 classes of Client/Server Computing: 

    * **Host-based**: dumb terminal, traditional mainframe
    * **Server-based â€“ aka Thin Client**: server does all processing, client only does presentation.
    * **Cooperative (Fat Client)**: application logic is shared  between client & server, complex to setup but greater user productivity & network effeciency.
    * **Client-based (Fat Client)**: **Most common model**, all processing done at client, only DB logic at server side. Represented by Relational Database, example is SQL database provides db service to Client side.

    **Fat Client v/s Thin Client**

     | Fat Client	| Thin Client
---|---|---
**Advantage** | less bottle neck at server side | migration path from mainframe to distributed computing network  
**Disadvantage**	| difficult to maintain, upgrade (involving hundress of desktops) | bottleneck at server side due to high processing load

2. **Three-Tier Architecture**: Thin client, middle tier server, and database.

3. **Middleware**: standard programming interface between client app, server service and OS.
4. **Distributed Message Passing**: rely on message passing to communicate between client & server. Example: RPC (Remote Procedure Calls): CALL P(X,Y), X is parameter, Y is return value. 
    * There are **2 types of RPC binding**: Non-persistent (connection is closed after completion), and persistent (connection stays idle for a while). 
    * There are 2 types of RPCs: synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (nonblocking, parallelism).


## Network Structure
> LAN, WAN

### LAN
Network communication can be implemented by:

* **Ethernet** (multiaccess bus): simple, reliable, cost effective; or
* **Token Ring**: deterministic, far distance, great throughput under heavy load. 
    * _Cons_: Require special HW thus increase cost, and risk of losing token.


### WAN
> * Originated from Arpanet 1968, a packet switching network.
> * Or PPP (Point-to-Point) connection over modems.


## Network Topology
> Has different topologies, such as Fully Connected Network, Partially Connected Network, Tree-Structured, Star Network, or Ring Network.

## Communication Structure
5 basic problems to solve: **Naming and name resolution**, **Routing strategies**, **connection strategies**, and **Contention**.

### Naming and Name Resolution

* Identify Process by `<Hostname, IP Address>`
* FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name): www.google.com, sau@svuca.edu, etc. The resolving is reversed order, right to left.

### Routing Strategies

* **Fixed Routing**: direct path between A-B is pre-defined. 
    * _Pros_: shortest path can be chosen to minimize cost, ensure ordering of messages.
    * _Cons_: unable to adapt load changes.

* **Virtual Circuit**: a path from A to B is defined for the session duration. Same pros as Fixed Routing, and improve the handling of load changes by specifying the path avoiding congestion.

* **Dynamic Routing**: path between A to B is chosen when a message is sent, by the router or hops. 
    * _Pros_: adapt to load changes
    * _Cons_: message may arrive out of order.

### Packet Strategies

* **UDP**: unreliable message, no guarantee it reach the destination.
* **TCP**: reliable message, guarantee reaching destination.

## Communication Structure
**3 Connection strategies (scheme):**
1. **Circuit Switching** -  a permanent link is established _throughout the communication session_ (telephone/modem). 
2. **Message Switching** - a temporary link is established _during one message tranfer_.
3. **Packet Switching** - split the message into smaller fixed-length packets and dispatching to the destination, regardless of orders, routes.

**Pros/Cons**:

* Circuit Switching requires more setup time, but less overhead for each message, may waste bandwidth if idle.
* Message and Packet switching less setup time, but more overhead per message.

### Contention
There are 2 methods to solve contention in communication.

1. **Token Passing**: circulates a token in the system.
2. **Message Slots** (Ring structure): reserve slots for communication.

## Communication Protocols

* ISO (from bottom up): Transport layer, Session layer, Presentation layer, Application layer.
* TCP/IP (from bottom up): Physical, Data Link, IP, TCP-UDP, (HTTP, DNS) etc.

## Robustness
> Able to detect link failure, site failure or message lost. 

## Reconfiguration
> Ability to reconfigure & recover on failure and resume operation.

## Design Issues
To be considered when designing a distributed system structures:

* Transparency
* Fault Tolerance 
* Scalability
* Clusters
