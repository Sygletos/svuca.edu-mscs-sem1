K-Means Clustering

Author: Ryan Flynn <parseerror+k-means@gmail.com>

Standard Algorithm[1]
 1. k initial "means" are randomly selected from the data set.
 2. k clusters are created by associating every observation with the nearest mean.
 3. The centroid of each of the k clusters becomes the new means.
 4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until convergence has been reached.
